X<Wall, Larry>
X<Larry Wall>

Larry Wall's studies of linguistics and human languages influenced the
design of Perl. The language allows you tremendous freedom to solve your
problems, depending on your group style, the available time, the expected
lifespan of the program, or even how creative you feel. You may write simple,
straightforward code or integrate into larger, well-defined programs. You may
select from multiple design paradigms, and you may eschew or embrace advanced
features.

Where other languages enforce one best way to write any code, Perl allows
I<you> to decide what's most readable or useful or fun.

X<TIMTOWTDI>
X<Tim Toady>

Perl hackers have a slogan for this: I<TIMTOWTDI>, pronounced "Tim Toady", or
"There's more than one way to do it!"

Though this expressivity allows master craftworkers to create amazing programs,
it allows the unwise or uncautious to make messes. Experience and good taste
will guide you to write great code. The choice is yours--but be mindful of
readability and maintainability, especially for those who come after you.

Perl novices often may find certain constructs opaque. Many of these idioms
(L<idioms>) offer great (if subtle) power. It's okay to avoid them until you're
comfortable with them.

Learning Perl is like learning a new spoken language. You'll learn a few words,
string together sentences, and soon will enjoy simple conversations.  Mastery
comes with practice of reading and writing. You don't have to understand every
detail of Perl to be productive, but the principles in this chapter are vital
to your growth as a programmer.

As another design goal, Perl tries to avoid surprising experienced (Perl)
programmers.  For example, adding two variables (C<$first_num + $second_num>)
is obviously a numeric operation (L<numeric_operators>); the addition operator
must treat both as numeric values to produce a numeric result. No matter the
contents of C<$first_num> and C<$second_num>, Perl will coerce them to numeric
values (L<numeric_coercion>). You've expressed your intent to treat them as
numbers by using a numeric operator. Perl happily does so.

X<DWIM>
X<principle of least astonishment>

Perl adepts often call this principle I<DWIM>, or I<do what I mean>.  Another
phrasing is that Perl follows the I<principle of least astonishment>.  Given a
cursory understanding of Perl (especially context; L<context_philosophy>), it
should be possible to understand the intent of an unfamiliar Perl expression.
You will develop this skill.

X<baby Perl>

Perl's expressivity also allows novices to write useful programs without having
to understand everything. The resulting code is often called I<baby Perl>, in
the sense that most everyone wants to help babies learn to communicate well.
Everyone begins as a novice. Through practice and learning from more experienced
programmers, you will understand and adopt more powerful idioms and techniques.

For example, an experienced Perl hacker might triple a list of numbers with:

=begin programlisting

    my @tripled = map { $_ * 3 } @numbers;

=end programlisting

... and a Perl adept might write:

=begin programlisting

    my @tripled;

    for my $num (@numbers)
    {
        push @tripled, $num * 3;
    }

=end programlisting

... while a novice might try:

=begin programlisting

    my @tripled;

    for (my $i = 0; $i < scalar @numbers; $i++)
    {
        $tripled[$i] = $numbers[$i] * 3;
    }

=end programlisting

All three approaches accomplish the same thing, but each uses Perl in a
different way.

Experience writing Perl will help you to focus on I<what> you want to do rather
than I<how> to do it. Even so, Perl will happily run simple programs. You can
design and refine your programs for clarity, expressivity, reuse, and
maintainability, in part or in whole. Take advantage of this flexibility and
pragmatism: it's far better to accomplish your task effectively now than to
write a conceptually pure and beautiful program next year.
