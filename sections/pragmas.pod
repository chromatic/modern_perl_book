=head1 Pragmas

Z<pragmas>

X<pragmas>
X<modules; pragmas>

Most Perl 5 extensions are modules which provide new functions or define
classes (L<moose>). Some modules instead influence the behavior of the language
itself, such as C<strict> or C<warnings>. Such a module is a I<pragma>. By
convention, pragmas have lower-case names to differentiate them from other
modules.

=head2 Pragmas and Scope

X<pragmas; scope>

Pragmas work by exporting specific behavior or information into their caller
scopes--lexical scopes. Just as declaring a lexical variable makes a symbol
name available within a scope, using a pragma makes its behavior effective
within that scope:

=begin programlisting

    {
        # $lexical is B<not> visible; strict is B<not> in effect
        {
            use strict;
            my $lexical = 'available here';
            # $lexical B<is> visible; strict B<is> in effect
            ...
        }
        # $lexical is again B<not> visible; strict is B<not> in effect
    }

=end programlisting

Just as lexical declarations affect inner scopes, pragmas maintain their
effects within inner scopes:

=begin programlisting

    # file scope
    use strict;

    {
        # inner scope, but strict still in effect
        my $inner = 'another lexical';
        ...
    }

=end programlisting

=head2 Using Pragmas

X<pragmas; enabling>

C<use> a pragma as you would any other module. Pragmas take arguments, such as
a minimum version number to use and a list of arguments to change the pragma's
behavior:

=begin programlisting

    # require variable declarations; prohibit bareword function names
    use strict qw( subs vars );

=end programlisting

X<pragmas; disabling>
X<builtins; C<no>>

Disable all or part of a pragma with the C<no> builtin. This also respects
lexical scoping:

=begin programlisting

    use strict;

    {
        # get ready to manipulate the symbol table
        no strict 'refs';
        ...
    }

=end programlisting

=head2 Useful Core Pragmas

X<pragmas; useful core pragmas>

Perl 5 includes several useful core pragmas:

X<pragmas; C<strict>>

=over 4

=item * the C<strict> pragma enables compiler checking of symbolic references,
bareword use, and variable declaration

X<pragmas; C<warnings>>

=item * the C<warnings> pragma enables optional warnings for deprecated,
unintended, and awkward behaviors.

X<pragmas; C<utf8>>

=item * the C<utf8> pragma forces the parser to interpret the source code with
UTF-8 encoding

X<pragmas; C<autodie>>

=item * the C<autodie> pragma enables automatic error checking of system calls
and builtins

X<pragmas; C<constant>>

=item * the C<constant> pragma allows you to create compile-time constant
values (see the CPAN's C<Const::Fast> for an alternative)

X<pragmas; C<vars>>

=item * the C<vars> pragma allows you to declare package global variables, such
as C<$VERSION> or C<@ISA> (L<blessed_references>)

X<pragmas; C<feature>>

=item * the C<feature> pragma allows you to enable and disable post-5.10
features of Perl 5 individually. Where C<use 5.14;> enables all of the Perl
5.14 features and the C<strict> pragma, C<use feature ':5.14';> does the same.
This pragma is more useful to I<disable> individual features in a lexical
scope.

=back

X<magic variables; C<$^H>>
X<pragmas; writing>

Perl 5.10.0 added the ability to write your own lexical pragmas in pure Perl
code. C<perldoc perlpragma> explains how to do so, while the explanation of
C<$^H> in C<perldoc perlvar> explains how the feature works. The CPAN has begun
to gather useful pragmas, including:

X<CPAN; C<autobox>>
X<CPAN; C<perl5i>>
X<CPAN; C<autovivification>>
X<CPAN; C<indirect>>

=over 4

=item * C<autobox> enables object-like behavior for Perl 5's core types
(scalars, references, arrays, and hashes).

=item * C<perl5i> combines and enables many experimental language extensions
into a coherent whole.

=item * C<autovivification> disables autovivification (L<autovivification>)

=item * C<indirect> prevents the use of indirect invocation
(L<indirect_objects>)

=back

These tools are not widely used yet. The latter two can help you write more
correct code, while the former two are worth experimenting with in small
projects. They represent what Perl 5 might be.
