Best Practical Solutions (U<http://bestpractical.com/>) maintains an
installation of their popular request tracking system, RT, for CPAN authors as
well as Perl 5 and Perl 6 development.  Every CPAN distribution has its own RT
queue, linked from C<search.cpan.org> and available on U<http://rt.cpan.org/>.
Perl 5 and Perl 6 have separate RT queues available on U<http://rt.perl.org/>.

There are plenty of events in the physical world as well.  The Perl community
holds a lot of conferences, workshops, and seminars.  In particular, the
community-run YAPC--Yet Another Perl Conference--is a successful, local,
low-cost conference model held on multiple continents.  See
U<http://yapc.org/>.

The Perl Foundation wiki lists other events at
U<http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?perl_events>.

There are also hundreds of local Perl Mongers groups which get together
frequently for technical talks and social interaction.  See
U<http://www.pm.org/>.

=head1 IRC

X<IRC>
X<IRC; #moose>
X<IRC; #catalyst>
X<IRC; #perl-help>
X<IRC; #perl>

When Perl mongers aren't at local meetings or conferences or workshops, many
collaborate and chat online through IRC, a textual group chat system from the
early days of the Internet.  Many of the most popular and useful Perl projects
have their own IRC channels, such as I<#moose> or I<#catalyst>.

The main server for Perl community is U<irc://irc.perl.org/>.  Other notable
channels include I<#perl-help>, for general assistance on Perl programming, and
I<#perl-qa>, devoted to testing and other quality issues.  Be aware that the
channel I<#perl> is I<not> for general help--instead, it's a general purpose
room for discussing whatever its participants want to discussN<... and it's not
often friendly to people who ask basic programming questions.>.
