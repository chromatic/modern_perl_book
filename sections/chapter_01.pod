=head0 The Perl Philosophy

Perl gets things done--it's flexible, forgiving, and malleable.  Capable
programmers use it every day for everything from one-liners and one-off
automations to multi-year, multi-programmer projects.

Perl is pragmatic. You're in charge. You decide how best to solve your problems
and Perl will mold itself to do what you mean, with little frustration and no
ceremony.

Perl will grow with you. In the next hour, you'll learn enough to write real,
useful programs--and you'll understand I<how> the language works and I<why> it
works as it does. Modern Perl takes advantage of this knowledge and the
combined experience of the global Perl community to help you write working,
maintainable code.

First, you need to know how to learn more.
