Z<perldoc>

One of Perl's most useful and least appreciated features is the C<perldoc>
utility.  This program is part of every complete Perl 5 installationN<You may
have to install an additional package on a free GNU/Linux distribution or
another Unix-like system; on Debian and Ubuntu this is C<perl-doc>.>.  It
displays the documentation of every Perl module installed on the
system--whether a core module or one installed from the Comprehensive Perl
Archive Network (CPAN)--as well as thousands of pages of Perl's copious core
documentation.

=begin sidebar

If you prefer an online version, U<http://perldoc.perl.org/> hosts recent
versions of the Perl documentation.  U<http://search.cpan.org/> displays the
documentation of every module on the CPAN.  Windows users, both ActivePerl and
Strawberry Perl provide a link in your Start menu to the documentation.

=end sidebar

The default behavior of C<perldoc> is to display the documentation for a named
module or a specific section of the core documentation:

=begin screen

    $ B<perldoc List::Util>
    $ B<perldoc perltoc>
    $ B<perldoc Moose::Manual>

=end screen

The first example extracts documentation written for the C<List::Util> module
and displays it in a form appropriate for your screen.  Community standards for
CPAN modules (L<cpan>) suggest that additional libraries use the same
documentation format and form as core modules, so there's no distinction
between reading the documentation for a core library such as C<Data::Dumper> or
one installed from the CPAN.  The standard documentation template includes a
description of the module, demonstrates sample uses, and then contains a
detailed explanation of the module and its interface.  While the amount of
documentation varies by author, the form of the documentation is remarkably
consistent.

The second example displays a pure documentation file, in this case the table
of contents of the core documentation itself.  This file describes each
individual piece of the core documentation; browse it for a good understanding
of Perl's breadth.

The third example resembles the second; C<Moose::Manual> is part of the Moose
CPAN distribution (L<moose>).  It is also purely documentation; it contains no
code.

Similarly, C<perldoc perlfaq> will display the table of contents for Frequently
Asked Questions about Perl 5.  Skimming these questions is invaluable.

X<perldoc; C<-q> (search perlfaq)>

The C<perldoc> utility has many more abilities (see C<perldoc perldoc>).  Two
of the most useful are the C<-q> and the C<-f> flags.  The C<-q> flag takes a
keyword or keywords and searches only the Perl FAQ, displaying all results.
Thus C<perldoc -q sort> returns three questions: I<How do I sort an array by
(anything)?>, I<How do I sort a hash (optionally by value instead of key)?>,
and I<How can I always keep my hash sorted?>.

X<perldoc; C<-f> (search perlfunc)>

The C<-f> flag displays the core documentation for a builtin Perl function.
C<perldoc -f sort> explains the behavior of the C<sort> operator.  If you don't
know the name of the function you want, use C<perldoc perlfunc> to see a list
of functions.

=begin sidebar

C<perldoc perlop> and C<perldoc perlsyn> document Perl's symbolic operators and
syntactic constructs; C<perldoc perldiag> explains the meanings of Perl's
warning messages.

=end sidebar

X<POD>

Perl 5's documentation system is I<POD>, or I<Plain Old Documentation>.
C<perldoc perlpod> describes how POD works.  The C<perldoc> utility will
display the POD in any Perl module you create and install for your project, and
other POD tools such as C<podchecker>, which validates the form of your POD,
and C<Pod::Webserver>, which displays local POD as HTML through a minimal web
server, will handle valid POD correctly.

X<perldoc; C<-l> (list path to POD)>
X<perldoc; C<-m> (show raw POD)>

C<perldoc> has other uses.  With the C<-l> command-line flag, it displays the
I<path> to the documentation file rather than the contents of the
documentationN<Be aware that a module may have a separate F<.pod> file in
addition to its F<.pm> file.>.  With the C<-m> flag, it displays the entire
I<contents> of the module, code and all, without processing any POD
instructions.
