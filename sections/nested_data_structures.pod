=head2 Nested Data Structures

Z<nested_data_structures>
X<data structures>
X<nested data structures>

Perl's aggregate data types--arrays and hashes--allow you to store scalars
indexed by integers or string keys.  Perl 5's references (L<references>) allow
you to access aggregate data types indirectly, through special scalars.  Nested
data structures in Perl, such as an array of arrays or a hash of hashes, are
possible through the use of references.

=head3 Declaring Nested Data Structures

A simple declaration of an array of arrays might be:

=begin programlisting

    my @famous_triplets = (
        [qw( eenie miney moe )],
        [qw( huey dewey louie )],
        [qw( duck duck goose )],
    );

=end programlisting

... and a simple declaration of a hash of hashes might be:

=begin programlisting

    my %meals = (
        breakfast => { entree => 'eggs',   side => 'hash browns' },
        lunch     => { entree => 'panini', side => 'apple' },
        dinner    => { entree => 'steak',  side => 'avocado salad' },
    );

=end programlisting

=begin sidebar

Perl allows but does not require the trailing comma so to ease adding new
elements to the list.

=end sidebar

=head3 Accessing Nested Data Structures

Accessing elements in nested data structures uses Perl's reference syntax.  The
sigil denotes the amount of data to retrieve, and the dereferencing arrow
indicates that the value of one portion of the data structure is a reference:

=begin programlisting

    my $last_nephew = $famous_triplets[1]->[2];
    my $breaky_side = $meals{breakfast}->{side};

=end programlisting

In the case of a nested data structure, the only way to nest a data structure
is through references, thus the arrow is superfluous.  This code is equivalent
and clearer:

=begin programlisting

    my $last_nephew = $famous_triplets[1][2];
    my $breaky_side = $meals{breakfast}{side};

=end programlisting

=begin sidebar

You can avoid the arrow in every case except invoking a function reference
stored in a nested data structure, where the arrow invocation syntax is the
clearest mechanism of invocation.

=end sidebar

Accessing components of nested data structures as if they were first-class
arrays or hashes requires disambiguation blocks:

=begin programlisting

    my $nephew_count   = @{ $famous_triplets[1] };
    my $dinner_courses = keys %{ $meals{dinner} };

=end programlisting

Similarly, slicing a nested data structure requires additional punctuation:

=begin programlisting

    my ($entree, $side) = @{ $meals{breakfast} }{qw( entree side )};

=end programlisting

The use of whitespace helps, but it does not entirely eliminate the noise of
this construct.  Sometimes using temporary variables can clarify:

=begin programlisting

    my $breakfast_ref   = $meals{breakfast};
    my ($entree, $side) = @$breakfast_ref{qw( entree side )};

=end programlisting

C<perldoc perldsc>, the data structures cookbook, gives copious examples of
various types of data structures available in Perl with their syntax.

=head3 Autovivification

Z<autovivification>
X<autovivification>

Perl's expressivity extends to nested data structures.  When you attempt to
write to a component of a nested data structure, Perl will create the path
through the data structure to that piece if it does not exist:

=begin programlisting

    my @aoaoaoa;

    $aoaoaoa[0][0][0][0] = 'nested deeply';

=end programlisting

After the second line of code, this array of arrays of arrays of arrays
contains an array reference in an array reference in an array reference in an
array reference.  Each array reference contains one element.  Similarly,
treating an undefined value as if it were a hash reference in a nested data
structure will create intermediary hashes, keyed appropriately:

=begin programlisting

    my %hohoh;

    $hohoh{Robot}{Santa}{Claus} = 'mostly harmful';

=end programlisting

X<autovivification>

This behavior is I<autovivification>, and it's more often useful than it isn't.
Its benefit is in reducing the initialization code of nested data structures.
Its drawback is in its inability to distinguish between the honest intent to
create missing elements in nested data structures and typos.

The C<autovivification> pragma on the CPAN (L<pragmas>) lets you disable
autovivification in a lexical scope for specific types of operations; it's
worth your time to consider this in large projects, or projects with multiple
developers.

=begin programlisting

You can also check for the existence of specific hash keys and the number of
elements in arrays before dereferencing each level of a complex data structure,
but that can produce tedious, lengthy code which many programmers prefer to
avoid.

=end programlisting

=head3 Debugging Nested Data Structures

The complexity of Perl 5's dereferencing syntax combined with the potential for
confusion with multiple levels of references can make debugging nested data
structures difficult.  Two good options exist for visualizing them.

X<Data::Dumper>

The core module C<Data::Dumper> can stringify values of arbitrary complexity
into Perl 5 code:

=begin programlisting

    use Data::Dumper;

    print Dumper( $my_complex_structure );

=end programlisting

This is useful for identifying what a data structure contains, what you should
access, and what you accessed instead.  C<Data::Dumper> can dump objects as
well as function references (if you set C<$Data::Dumper::Deparse> to a true
value).

While C<Data::Dumper> is a core module and prints Perl 5 code, it also produces
verbose output.  Some developers prefer the use of the C<YAML::XS> or C<JSON>
modules for debugging.  You have to learn a different format to understand
their outputs, but their outputs can be much clearer to read and to understand.

=head3 Circular References

Z<circular_references>

X<circular references>
X<memory management; circular references>
X<memory management>
X<garbage collection>

Perl 5's memory management system of reference counting (L<reference_counts>)
has one drawback apparent to user code.  Two references which end up pointing
to each other form a I<circular reference> that Perl cannot destroy on its own.
Consider a biological model, where each entity has two parents and can have
children:

=begin programlisting

    my $alice  = { mother => '',     father => '',      children => [] };
    my $robert = { mother => '',     father => '',      children => [] };
    my $cianne = { mother => $alice, father => $robert, children => [] };

    push @{ $alice->{children}  }, $cianne;
    push @{ $robert->{children} }, $cianne;

=end programlisting

Because both C<$alice> and C<$robert> contain an array reference which contains
C<$cianne>, and because C<$cianne> is a hash reference which contains C<$alice>
and C<$robert>, Perl can never decrease the reference count of any of these
three people to zero.  It doesn't recognize that these circular references
exist, and it can't manage the lifespan of these entities.

X<references; weak>
X<weak references>
X<Scalar::Util>

You must either break the reference count manually yourself (by clearing the
children of C<$alice> and C<$bob> or the parents of C<$cianne>), or take
advantage of a feature called I<weak references>.  A weak reference is a
reference which does not increase the reference count of its referent.  Weak
references are available through the core module C<Scalar::Util>.  Export the
C<weaken()> function and use it on a reference to prevent the reference count
from increasing:

=begin programlisting

    use Scalar::Util 'weaken';

    my $alice  = { mother => '',     father => '',      children => [] };
    my $robert = { mother => '',     father => '',      children => [] };
    my $cianne = { mother => $alice, father => $robert, children => [] };

    push @{ $alice->{children}  }, $cianne;
    push @{ $robert->{children} }, $cianne;

    B<< weaken( $cianne->{mother} ); >>
    B<< weaken( $cianne->{father} ); >>

=end programlisting

With this accomplished, C<$cianne> will retain references to C<$alice> and
C<$robert>, but those references will not by themselves prevent Perl's garbage
collector from destroying those data structures.  You rarely have to use weak
references if you design your data structures correctly, but they're useful in
a few situations.

=head3 Alternatives to Nested Data Structures

While Perl is content to process data structures nested as deeply as you can
imagine, the human cost of understanding these data structures as well as the
relationship of various pieces, not to mention the syntax required to access
various portions, can be high.  Beyond two or three levels of nesting, consider
whether modeling various components of your system with classes and objects
(L<moose>) will allow you to operate on your data within encapsulation
boundaries.

Sometimes bundling data with behaviors appropriate to that data can clarify
code.
