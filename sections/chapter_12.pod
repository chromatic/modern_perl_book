=head0 What's Missing

Perl 5 isn't perfect, at least as it behaves by default.  Some options are
available in the core.  More are available from the CPAN.  Experienced Perl
developers have their own idea of how an ideal Perl 5 should behave, and they
often use their own configurations very effectively.

Novices may not know how Perl can help them write programs better.  A handful
of core modules will make you much more productive.
