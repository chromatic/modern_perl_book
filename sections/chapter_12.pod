Perl 5 isn't perfect, but it's malleable--in part because no single
configuration is ideal for every programmer and every purpose. Some useful
behaviors are available as core libraries. More are available from the CPAN.
Your effectiveness as a Perl programmer depends on you taking advantage of
these enhancements.
