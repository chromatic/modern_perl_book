=head0 The Perl Language

The Perl language has several smaller parts which combine to form its syntax.
Unlike spoken language, where nuance and tone of voice and intuition allow
people to communicate despite slight misunderstandings and fuzzy concepts,
computers and source code require precision.  You can write effective Perl code
without knowing every detail of every language feature, but you must understand
how they work together to write Perl code well.
