=head2 Global Variables

Z<globals>

X<super globals>
X<variables; super global>

Perl 5 provides several I<super global variables> that are truly global, not
restricted to any specific package.  These super globals have two drawbacks.
First, they're global; any direct or indirect modifications may have effects on
other parts of the program.  Second, they're terse.  Experienced Perl 5
programmers have memorized some of them.  Few people have memorized all of
them.  Only a handful are ever useful.  C<perldoc perlvar> contains the
exhaustive list of such variables.

=head3 Managing Super Globals

X<super globals; managing>
X<local>

The best approach to managing the global behavior of these super globals is to
avoid using them.  When you must use them, use C<local> in the smallest
possible scope to constrain any modifications.  You are still susceptible to
any changes code you I<call> makes to those globals, but you reduce the
likelihood of surprising code I<outside> of your scope.

=begin sidebar

Workarounds exist for some of this global behavior, but many of these variables
have existed since Perl 1 and will continue as part of Perl 5 throughout its
lifetime.  As the easy file slurping idiom (L<easy_file_slurping>)
demonstrates, this is often possible:

=begin programlisting

    my $file = do { B<local $/> = <$fh> };

=end programlisting

The effect of C<local>izing C<$/> lasts only through the end of the block.
There is a low chance that any Perl code will run as a result of reading lines
from the filehandleN<A tied filehandle is one of the few possibilities.> and
change the value of C<$/> within the C<do> block.

Not all cases of using super globals are this easy to guard, but this often
works.

X<eval>
X<exceptions; catching>

Other times you need to I<read> the value of a super global and hope that no
other code has modified it.  Catching exceptions with an C<eval> block can be
susceptible to race conditionsN<< Use C<Try::Tiny> instead! >>, in that
C<DESTROY()> methods invoked on lexicals that have gone out of scope may reset
C<$@>:

=begin programlisting

    local $@;

    eval { ... };

    if (B<my $exception = $@>) { ... }

=end programlisting

Copy C<$@> I<immediately> to preserve its contents.

=end sidebar

=head3 English Names

X<english>

The core C<English> module provides verbose names for the punctuation-heavy
super globals.  Import them into a namespace with:

=begin programlisting

    use English '-no_match_vars';

=end programlisting

Subsequently you can use the verbose names documented in C<perldoc perlvar>
within the scope of this namespace.

=begin sidebar

X<$&>
X<globals; $&>
X<$`>
X<globals; $`>
X<$'>
X<globals; $'>

Three regex-related super globals (C<$&>, C<$`>, and C<$'>) impose a global
performance penalty for I<all> regular expressions within a program.  If you
neglect to provide that import flag, your program will suffer the penalty even
if you don't explicitly read from those variables.  This is not the default
behavior for backwards-compatibility concerns.

Modern Perl programs should use the C<@-> variable as a replacement for the
terrible three.

=end sidebar

=head3 Useful Super Globals

X<super globals; useful>

Most modern Perl 5 programs can get by with using only a couple of the super
globals.  Several exist for special circumstances you're unlikely to encounter.
While C<perldoc perlvar> is the canonical documentation for most of these
variables, some deserve special mention.

=begin table Super Globals

=headrow

=cell Global

=cell English name

=cell Description

=bodyrows

=row

=cell C<$/>

=cell C<$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR>

=cell A string of zero or more characters which denotes the end of a record
when reading input a line at a time.  By default, this is your
platform-specific newline character sequence.  If you undefine this value, Perl
will attempt to read the entire file into memory.  If you set this value to a
I<reference> to an integer, Perl will try to read that many I<bytes> per record
(so beware of Unicode concerns).

=row

=cell C<$.>

=cell C<$INPUT_LINE_NUMBER>

=cell The current line (more accurately, I<record>) number read from the most
recently-accessed filehandle.  You can read from this variable, but writing to
it has no effect.  Localizing this variable will localize the filehandle to
which it refers.

=row

=cell C<$|>

=cell C<$OUTPUT_AUTOFLUSH>

=cell The boolean value of this variable governs whether Perl will flush
everything written to the currently selected filehandle immediately or only
when Perl's buffer is full.  Unbuffered output is useful when writing to a pipe
or socket or terminal which should not block waiting for input.

=row

=cell C<@ARGV>

=cell (none)

=cell The command-line arguments passed to the program.

=row

=cell C<$!>

=cell C<$ERRNO>

=cell A dualvar (L<dualvars>) which contains the result of the I<most recent>
system call.  In numeric context, this corresponds to C's C<errno> value, where
anything other than zero indicates some kind of error.  In string context,
returns the appropriate system error string.  Localize this variable before
performing a system call (implicitly or explicitly) to avoid overwriting the
appropriate value for other code elsewhere.
Many places within Perl 5 itself make system calls without your knowledge.  The
value of this variable can change out from under you, so copy it I<immediately>
after making such a call yourself.

=row

=cell C<$">

=cell C<$LIST_SEPARATOR>

=cell A string used to separate array and list elements interpolated into a
string.

=row

=cell C<%+>

=cell (none)

=cell The variable containing named captures from successful regular expression
matches (L<named_captures>).

=row

=cell C<$@>

=cell C<$EVAL_ERROR>

=cell The value thrown from the most recent exception (L<catching_exceptions>).

=row

=cell C<$0>

=cell C<$PROGRAM_NAME>

=cell The name of the program currently executing.  You may modify this value
on some Unix-like platforms to change the name of the program as it appears to
other programs on the system, such as C<ps> or C<top>.

=row

=cell C<$$>

=cell C<$PID>

=cell The process id of the currently running instance of the program, as the
operating system understands it.  This will vary between C<fork()>ed programs
and may vary between threads in the same program.

=row

=cell C<@INC>

=cell (none)

=cell A list of filesystem paths in which Perl will look for files to load with
C<use> or C<require>.  See C<perldoc -f require> for other items this array can
contain.

=row

=cell C<%SIG>

=cell (none)

=cell A hash which maps OS and low-level Perl signals to function references
used to handle those signals.  Trap the standard Ctrl-C interrupt by catching
the C<INT> signal, for example.  See C<perldoc perlipc> for more information
about signals and especially safe signals.

=head3 Alternatives to Super Globals

X<super globals; alternatives>

The worst culprits for action at a distance relate to IO and exceptional
conditions.  Using C<Try::Tiny> (L<exception_caveats>) will help insulate you
from the tricky semantics of proper exception handling.  C<local>izing and
copying the value of C<$!> can help you avoid strange behaviors when Perl makes
implicit system calls.

You can use methods on lexical filehandles (L<lexical_filehandles>) rather than
IO-related super globals by C<use>ing C<IO::Handle>.  In place of C<select>ing
a filehandle, then manipulating C<$|>, call the C<autoflush()> method on the
lexical filehandle directly.  Use the C<input_line_number()> method to get the
equivalent of C<$.> for that specific filehandle.  See the C<IO::Handle>
documentation for other appropriate methods.
