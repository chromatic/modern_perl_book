X<function>
X<subroutine>

A I<function> (or I<subroutine>) in Perl is a discrete, encapsulated unit of
behavior. A program is a collection of little black boxes where the interaction
of these functions governs the control flow of the program. A function may have
a name. It may consume incoming information. It may produce outgoing
information.

Functions are a prime mechanism for abstraction, encapsulation, and re-use in
Perl 5.
