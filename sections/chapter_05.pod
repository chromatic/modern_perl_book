X<function>
X<subroutine>

A I<function> (or I<subroutine>) in Perl is a discrete, encapsulated unit of
behavior.  It may or may not have a name.  It may or may not consume incoming
information.  It may or may not produce outgoing information.  It represents a
type of control flow, where the execution of the program proceeds to another
point in the source code.

Functions are a prime mechanism for abstraction, encapsulation, and re-use in
Perl 5; many other mechanisms build on the idea of the function.
