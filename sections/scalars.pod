=head3 Scalars

Z<scalars>

X<scalar>

One of Perl 5's fundamental data types is the scalar.  This represents a
single, discrete value.  That value may be a string, an integer, a floating
point value, an object, or a reference -- but it is always a single value.

As you might expect from the name, scalar values have a close relationship with
scalar L<context>.  Assigning the result of a function call to a scalar
variable enforces scalar context on the function call.

Scalars may be lexical or global variables.

Scalar names appearing explicitly in source code must conform to the L<names>
guidelines.

When accessing variables in Perl 5, the leading dollar-sign (C<$>) L<sigil>
indicates that the value is a scalar value.  If you have three variables named
C<$user>, C<@user>, and C<%user> as well as a subroutine named C<user()>, the
sigil can differentiate between all three.

=begin sidebar

This is not I<universally> true; the scalar sigil applied to an operation on an
aggregate variable determines the type of value accessed through that
operation; see L<arrays> and L<hashes> for more.

=end sidebar

Perl 5 scalars do not have static typing; a scalar variable can contain any
type of scalar value without special conversions or casts.  Thus this code is
all legal:

=begin programlisting

    my $value;
    $value = 123.456;
    $value = 77;
    $value = "I am Chuck's big toe.";
    $value = Store::IceCream->new();

=end programlisting

Even though this is I<legal>, it can be confusing to readers of the code.

As mentioned in L<context>, Perl 5 performs conversions when accessing the
value of a scalar in specific contexts.  You may treat the contents of a scalar
as a string, even if you didn't explicitly assign it a string:

=begin programlisting

    my $zip_code        = 97006;
    my $city_state_zip  = 'Beaverton, Oregon' . ' ' . $zip_code;

=end programlisting

You may also perform mathematical operations on strings:

=begin programlisting

    my $call_sign = 'KB7MIU';
    my $next_sign = $call_sign++;

    # also fine as
    $next_sign    = ++$call_sign;

    # but I<does not work> as:
    $next_sign    = $call_sign + 1;

=end programlisting

X<increment; string>

=begin sidebar

Note that this magical string increment behavior does not have a corresponding
magical decrement behavior.  You can't get the previous string value by writing
C<$call_sign-->.

=end sidebar

Magical string increment turns C<a> into C<b> and C<z> into C<aa>, respecting
character set and case.  Note that C<ZZ9> becomes C<ZZ0> and C<ZZ09> becomes
C<ZZ10>, however -- numbers wrap around but do not carry to alphabetic
components.

X<stringification>
X<numification>

Mention this here or move it elsewhere?

Perl 5 stringifies L<references> evaluated in scalar string context and
numifies references evaluated in scalar numeric context.

X<Scalar::Util>
X<dualvars>
X<dualvar; Scalar::Util>

Perl 5 scalars have a unique property in that they can contain numeric parts as
well as string parts.  Perl 5 can store both a numeric value and a string value
in the internal data structure which represents scalars.  The core
C<Scalar::Util> module's C<dualvar()> function allows you to store these values
explicitly.

X<looks_like_number>
X<looks_like_number;Scalar::Util>

Similarly, the C<looks_like_number()> function returns true if the scalar value provided is something Perl 5 would interpret as a number.
