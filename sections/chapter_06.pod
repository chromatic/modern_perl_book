Perl's text processing power comes from its use of I<regular expressions>.  A
regular expression (I<regex> or I<regexp>) is a I<pattern> which describes
characteristics of a piece of text. A I<regular expression engine> interprets
patterns and applies them to match or modify pieces of text.

Perl's core regex documentation includes a tutorial (C<perldoc perlretut>), a
reference guide (C<perldoc perlreref>), and full documentation (C<perldoc
perlre>). Jeffrey Friedl's book I<Mastering Regular Expressions> explains the
theory and the mechanics of how regular expressions work. While mastering
regular expressions is a daunting pursuit, a little knowledge will give you
great power.
