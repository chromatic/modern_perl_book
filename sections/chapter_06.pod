Perl's text processing power comes from its use of I<regular expressions>.  A
regular expression (I<regex> or I<regexp>) is a I<pattern> which describes
characteristics of a piece of text. A I<regular expression engine> interprets
patterns and applies them to match or modify pieces of text.

Perl's core documentation--C<perldoc perlretut>, C<perldoc perlreref>, and
C<perldoc perlre>--includes a regex tutorial, a reference guide, and full
documentation, respectively. Jeffrey Friedl's book I<Mastering Regular
Expressions> explains the theory and the mechanics of how regular expressions
work. While mastering regular expressions is a daunting pursuit, a little
knowledge will give you great power.
