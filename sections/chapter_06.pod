Perl's powerful ability to manipulate text comes in part from its inclusion of
a computing concept known as I<regular expressions>.  A regular expression
(often shortened to I<regex> or I<regexp>) is a I<pattern> which describes
characteristics of a string of text.  A I<regular expression engine> interprets
a pattern and applies it to strings of text to identify those which match.

Perl's core documentation describes Perl regular expressions in copious detail;
see C<perldoc perlretut>, C<perldoc perlre>, and C<perldoc perlreref> for a
tutorial, the full documentation, and a reference guide, respectively.  Jeffrey
Friedl's book I<Mastering Regular Expressions> explains the theory and the
mechanics of how regular expressions work.  Even though those references may
seem daunting, regular expressions are like Perl--you can do many things with
only a little knowledge.
