=head0 Style and Efficacy

Quality matters.

Programs have bugs. Programs need maintenance and expansion. Programs have
multiple programmers.

Programming well requires us to find a balance between getting the job done and
allowing us to do so well into the future. We can trade any of time, resources,
and quality for any other. How well we do that determines our skill as
pragmatic craftworkers.

Understanding Perl is important. So is cultivating a sense of good taste. The
only way to do so is to practice maintaining code and reading and writing great
code. This path has no shortcuts, but this path does have guideposts.
