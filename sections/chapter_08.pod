Programming and programming I<well> are related, but distinct skills.  If we
only wrote programs once and never had to modify or maintain them, if our
programs never had bugs, if we never had to choose between using more memory or
taking more time, and if we never had to work with other people, we wouldn't
have to worry about how well we program.  To program well, you must understand
the differences between potential solutions based on specific priorities of
time, resources, and future plans.

Writing Perl well means understanding how Perl works.  It also means developing
a sense of good taste.  To develop that skill, you must practice writing and
maintaining code and reading good code.  There are no shortcuts--but you can
improve the effectiveness of your practice by following a few guidelines.
