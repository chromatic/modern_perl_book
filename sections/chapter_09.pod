=head0 Writing Real Programs

Z<writing_real_programs>

Writing simple example programs to solve example problems in a book helps you
learn a language in the small.  Yet writing real programs requires more than
learning the syntax of a language, or its design principles, or even how to
find and use its libraries.

Practical programming requires you to manage code: to organize it, to know that
it works, to make it robust in the face of errors of logic or intent, and to do
all of this in a concise, clear, and maintainable fashion.  Fortunately, modern
Perl provides many tools and techniques to write real programs.
