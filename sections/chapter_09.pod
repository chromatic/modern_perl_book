Z<writing_real_programs>

A book can teach you to write small programs to solve small example problems.
You can learn a lot of syntax that way. To write real programs to solve real
problems, you must learn to I<manage> code written in your language. How do you
organize code? How do you know that it works? How can you make it robust in the
face of errors? What makes code concise, clear, and maintainable?

Modern Perl provides many tools and techniques to write real programs.
