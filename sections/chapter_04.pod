An accurate, if irreverent, description of Perl is an "operator-oriented
language".  The interaction of operators with their operands gives Perl its
expressivity and power.  Understanding Perl requires understanding its
operators and how they behave.  For the sake of this discussion, a working
definition of a Perl I<operator> is a series of one or more symbols used as
part of the syntax of a language.  Each operator operates on zero or more
I<operands>; this definition is circular, as an operand is a value on which an
operator operates.

The most accurate definition of operators is "What's in C<perlop>", but even
that leaves out some operators in C<perlsyn> and includes builtins.  Don't get
too attached to a single definition.
