Some people call Perl an "operator-oriented language". To understand a Perl
program, you must understand how its operators interact with their operands.

A Perl I<operator> is a series of one or more symbols used as part of the
syntax of a language. Each operator operates on zero or more I<operands>. Think
of an operator as a special sort of function the parser understands and its
operands as arguments.
