=head0 What to Avoid

Perl 5 isn't perfect.  Some features seemed like good ideas at the time, but
they're difficult to use correctly.  Others don't work as anyone might expect.
A few more are simply bad ideas.  These features will likely persist--removing
a feature from Perl is a serious process reserved for only the most egregious
offenses--but you can and should avoid them in almost every case.
