=head1 Distributions

Z<distributions>

X<distribution>

A I<distribution> is a collection of metadata and modules (L<modules>) which
forms a single redistributable, testable, and installable unit. The easiest way
to configure, build, package, test, and install Perl code is to follow the
CPAN's conventions. These conventions govern how to package a distribution, how
to resolve its dependencies, where to install software, how to verify that it
works, how to display documentation, and how to manage a repository. All of
these guidelines have arisen from the rough consensus of thousands of
contributors working on tens of thousands of projects. A distribution built to
CPAN standards can be tested on several versions of Perl on several different
hardware platforms within a few hours of its uploading, with errors reported
automatically to authors--all without human intervention.

You may choose never to release any of your code as public CPAN distributions,
but you I<can> use CPAN tools and conventions to manage even private code. The
Perl community has built amazing infrastructure; why not take advantage of it?

=head2 Attributes of a Distribution

Besides one or more modules, a distribution includes several other files and
directories:

=over 4

=item * F<Build.PL> or F<Makefile.PL>, a driver program used to configure,
build, test, bundle, and install the distribution.

=item * F<MANIFEST>, a list of all files contained in the distribution. This
helps tools verify that a bundle is complete.

=item * F<META.yml> and/or F<META.json>, a file containing metadata about the
distribution and its dependencies.

=item * F<README>, a description of the distribution, its intent, and its
copyright and licensing information.

=item * F<lib/>, the directory containing Perl modules.

=item * F<t/>, a directory containing test files.

=item * F<Changes>, a human-readable log of every significant change to the
distribution.

X<CPAN; CPANTS>

A well-formed distribution must contain a unique name and single version number
(often taken from its primary module). Any distribution you download from the
public CPAN should conform to these standards. The public CPANTS service
(U<http://cpants.perl.org/>) evaluates each uploaded distribution against
packaging guidelines and conventions and recommends improvements. Following the
CPANTS guidelines doesn't mean the code works, but it does mean that the CPAN
packaging tools should understand the distribution.

=head2 CPAN Tools for Managing Distributions

The Perl core includes several tools to manage distributions:

X<C<CPAN>>

=over 4

=item * C<CPAN.pm> is the official CPAN client. While by default this client
installs distributions from the public CPAN, you can also use your ownpoint them to your own
repository instead of or in addition to the public repository.

X<C<Module::Build>>

=item * C<Module::Build> is a pure-Perl tool suite for configuring, building,
installing, and testing distributions. It works with F<Build.PL> files.

X<C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>>

=item * C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> is a legacy tool which C<Module::Build> intends
to replace. It is still in wide use, though it is in maintenance mode and
receives only critical bug fixes. It works with F<Makefile.PL> files.

X<C<Test::More>>

=item * C<Test::More> (L<testing>) is the basic and most widely used testing
module used to write automated tests for Perl software.

X<C<TAP::Harness>>
X<C<prove>>

=item * C<TAP::Harness> and C<prove> (L<running_tests>) run tests and interpret
and report their results.

=back

In addition, several non-core CPAN modules make your life easier as a
developer:

X<CPAN; C<App::cpanminus>>
X<cpanminus>
X<cpanm>

=over 4

=item * C<App::cpanminus> is a configuration-free CPAN client. It handles the
most common cases, uses little memory, and works quickly.

X<CPAN; C<App::perlbrew>>
X<perlbrew>

=item * C<App::perlbrew> helps you to manage multiple installations of Perl.
Install new versions of Perl for testing or production, or to isolate
applications and their dependencies.

X<CPAN; C<CPAN::Mini>>
X<CPAN; C<cpanmini>>

=item * C<CPAN::Mini> and the C<cpanmini> command allow you to create your own
(private) mirror of the public CPAN.  You can inject your own distributions
into this repository and manage which versions of the public modules are
available in your organization.

X<CPAN; C<Dist::Zilla>>
X<CPAN; C<Module::Build>>
X<C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>>

=item * C<Dist::Zilla> automates away common distribution tasks. While it
uses either C<Module::Build> or C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>, it can replace I<your>
use of them directly. See U<http://dzil.org/> for an interactive tutorial.

X<CPAN; C<Test::Reporter>>

=item * C<Test::Reporter> allows you to report the results of running the
automated test suites of distributions you install, giving their authors more
data on any failures.

X<carton>
X<Pinto>

=item * Carton and Pinto are two newer projects which help manage and install
code's dependencies. Neither is in widespread use yet, but they're both under
active development.

=head2 Designing Distributions

X<CPAN; C<Module::Starter>>

The process of designing a distribution could fill a book (see Sam Tregar's
I<Writing Perl Modules for CPAN>), but a few design principles will help you.
Start with a utility such as C<Module::Starter> or C<Dist::Zilla>. The initial
cost of learning the configuration and rules may seem like a steep investment,
but the benefit of having everything set up the right way (and in the case of
C<Dist::Zilla>, I<never> going out of date) relieves you of tedious busywork.

A distribution should follow several non-code guidelines:

=over 4

=item * I<Each distribution performs a single, well-defined purpose.> That purpose
may even include gathering several related distributions into a single
installable bundle. Decompose your software into individual distributions to
manage their dependencies appropriately and to respect their encapsulation.

=item * I<Each distribution contains a single version number.> Version numbers
must always increase. The semantic version policy (U<http://semver.org/>) is
sane and compatible with the Perl 5 approach.

=item * I<Each distribution provides a well-defined API.> A comprehensive
automated test suite can verify that you maintain this API across versions.  If
you use a local CPAN mirror to install your own distributions, you can re-use
the CPAN infrastructure for testing distributions and their dependencies.  You
get easy access to integration testing across reusable components.

=item * I<Distribution tests are useful and repeatable.> The CPAN
infrastructure supports automated test reporting. Use it!

=item * I<Interfaces are simple and effective.> Avoid the use of global symbols
and default exports; allow people to use only what they need. Do not pollute
their namespaces.
