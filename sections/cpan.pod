=head2 The CPAN

Z<cpan>

If you have a problem, chances are someone's already started to solve it and
uploaded code to the CPAN.  Perl 5 is a pragmatic language.  It'll help you get
your work done.  Yet the ever-pragmatic Perl community has extended that
language and made their work available to the world.

The line between a modern language and its libraries is thin and fuzzy.  Is a
language only syntax?  Is it the core libraries?  Is it the availability of
external libraries and the ease at which you can use them within your own
projects?

X<CPAN>

Regardless of how you answer those questions for any other language, modern
Perl programming makes heavy use of the CPAN (U<http://www.cpan.org/>).  The
CPAN, or Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, is an uploading and mirroring
system for redistributable, reusable Perl code.  It's one of -- if not I<the>
largest -- archives of libraries of code in the world.

=begin sidebar

In the four months between the outline and first draft of this chapter, the
CPAN I<added> 500 registered uploaders and 7215 indexed modules in 1561
distributions.

    - 7258 uploaders/66400 modules/17268 distributions
    - 7758 uploaders/73615 modules/18829 distributions

=end sidebar

Several features make the CPAN powerful: almost all of them community
conventions that have grown up around the system.  Remember, at its heart it's
merely a distribution service.  When it works for you -- and it often does --
that's due to the hard work of thousands of volunteers.

X<distribution>
X<module>

CPAN mirrors I<distributions>, which tend to be collections of reusable Perl
code.  A single distribution can contain one or more I<module>, which is a
self-contained library of Perl code.  Each distribution lives in its own
namespace on the CPAN, contains its own metadata, and is buildable,
installable, updateable, and testable on its own.

X<search.cpan.org>

Many problems you're likely to encounter have stable and available CPAN
distributions available for your use, modification, and redistribution.  The
U<http://search.cpan.org/> website is often an effective way to browse
available distributions.

I don't like the tone of the following paragraph.  The rhetorical device grates.

If CPAN is merely a mirroring service, how do you know that any random CPAN
distribution is usable and useful?  As mentioned earlier, the community
standards which have grown up around the CPAN tend to improve the quality and
utility of code.  In particular, CPAN distributions have:

=item Standards for installation to work with automated CPAN installers.

=item Standards for metadata to describe what each distribution includes and any dependencies of the distribution.

=item Standards for documentation and licensing to describe what the
distribution does and how you may use it.

=back

Several additional services build in the CPAN to provide comprehensive
automated testing and reporting of every CPAN distribution for adherence to
packaging and distribution guidelines and correctness of behavior on various
platforms and versions of Perl.  Every CPAN distribution has its own ticket
queue on U<http://rt.cpan.org/> for reporting bugs and working with authors.
Distributions also have historical versions available on the CPAN, ratings,
annotations for the documentation, and other useful information.  All of this
is available from search.cpan.org.

X<CPAN.pm>
X<CPANPLUS>

Modern Perl installations include two clients to connect to, search, download,
build, test, and install CPAN distributions, CPAN and CPANPLUS.  They behave
equivalently; their use is a matter of taste.  This book recommends the use of
CPAN solely due to its ubiquity.

CPAN configuration is largely decision-free.  For any complete installation of
Perl, you may start the client with:

    $ B<cpan>

To install a distribution:

    $ B<cpan Modern::Perl>

Need fact-checking; what's the new configuration system?

=begin sidebar

Even though the CPAN client is a core module for the Perl 5 distribution, you
may also have to install standard development tools such as a C<make> utility
and possibly a C compiler to install all of the distributions you want.
Strawberry and Chocolate Perl include such utilities for Windows users.  Mac OS
X users need their developer tools installed; Unix and Unix-like users, consult
your local system administrator.

=end sidebar

For all of this configuration, you gain access to over 73,000 individual Perl
modules in almost 19,000 distributions.  These modules cover everything from
database access to profiling tools to protocols for almost every network device
ever created to sound and graphics libraries and wrappers for shared libraries
on your system.

Where's that link to the CPAN guide?  How about a section about local::lib
here?
