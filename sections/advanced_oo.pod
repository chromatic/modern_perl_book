=head2 Advanced OO Perl

Z<advanced_oo>

Creating and using objects in Perl 5 with Moose (L<moose>) is easy.
I<Designing> good object systems is not.  Additional capabilities for
abstraction also offer possibilities for obfuscation.  Only practical
experience can help you understand the most important design techniques... but
several principles can guide you.

=head3 Favor Composition Over Inheritance

Novice OO designs often overuse inheritance.  It's common to see class
hierarchies which try to model all of the behavior for entities within the
system in a single class.  This adds a conceptual overhead to understanding the
system, because you have to understand the hierarchy, and it adds technical
weight to every class, because conflicting responsibilities and methods may get
in the way of necessary behaviors or future modifications.

The encapsulation provided by classes offers better ways to organize code.  You
don't have to inherit from superclasses to provide behavior to users of
objects.  A C<Car> object does not have to inherit from a C<Vehicle::Wheeled>
object; it can contain several C<Wheel> objects as instance attributes.

Decomposing complex classes into smaller, focused entities (whether classes or
roles) improves encapsulation and reduces the possibility that any one class or
role will grow to do too much.  Smaller, simpler, and better encapsulated
entities are easier to understand, test, and maintain.

=head3 Single Responsibility Principle

When you design your object system, model the problem in terms of
responsibilities, or reasons why each specific entity may need to change.  For
example, an C<Employee> object may represent specific information about a
person's name, contact information, and other personal data, while a C<Job>
object may represent business responsibilities.  A simple design might conflate
the two into a single entity, but separating them allows the C<Employee> class
to consider only the problem of managing information specific to who the person
is and the C<Job> class to represent what the person does.  (Two C<Employees>
may have a C<Job>-sharing arrangement, for example.)

When each class has a single responsibility, you can improve the encapsulation
of class-specific data and behaviors and reduce coupling between classes.

=head3 Don't Repeat Yourself

Complexity and duplication complicate development and maintenance activities.
The DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a reminder to seek out and to
eliminate duplication within the system.  Duplication exists in many forms, in
data as well as in code.  If you find yourself repeating configuration
information, user data, and other artifacts within your system; instead, find a
canonical, single representation of that information, then generate all of the
other artifacts from that representation.

This principle helps to reduce the possibility that important parts of your
system can get unsynchronized, and helps you to find the optimal representation
of the system and its data.

=head3 Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov substitution principle suggests that subtypes of a given type
(specializations of a class or role or subclasses of a class) should be
substitutable for the parent type without narrowing the types of data they
receive or expanding the types of data they produce.  In other words, they
should be as general as or more general at what they expect and as specific as
or more specific about what they produce.

The easiest way to understand this is to imagine two classes, C<Dessert> and
C<PecanPie>, in which the latter subclasses the former.  If the classes follow
the Liskov substitution principle, you can replace every use of C<Dessert>
objects with C<PecanPie> objects in the test suite, and everything should
passN<See Reg Braithwaite's "IS-STRICTLY-EQUIVALENT-TO-A" for more details,

=head3 Subtypes and Coercions

Z<subtypes>
Z<coercions>
X<types>
X<subtypes>
X<coercion>

Moose allows you to declare and use types and extend them through subtypes to
form ever more specialized descriptions of what your data represents and how it
behaves.  You can use these type annotations to verify that the data on which
you want to work in specific functions or methods is appropriate and even to
specify mechanisms by which to coerce data of one type to data of another type.

See C<Moose::Util::TypeConstraints> and C<MooseX::Types> for more information.

=head3 Immutability

Z<immutability>

A common pattern among programmers new to object orientation is to treat
objects as if they were bundles of records which use methods to get and set
internal values.  While this is simple to implement and easy to understand, it
can lead to the unfortunate temptation to spread the behavioral
responsibilities among individual classes throughout the system.

The most useful technique to working with objects effectively is to tell them
what to do, not how to do it.  If you find yourself accessing the instance data
of objects (even through accessor methods), you may have too much access to the
responsibilities of the class.

One approach to preventing this behavior is to consider objects as immutable.
Pass in all of the relevant configuration data to their constructors, then
disallow any modifications of this information from outside the class.  Do not
expose any methods to mutate instance data.

Some designs go as far as to prohibit the modification of instance data
I<within> the class itself, though this is much more difficult to achieve.
