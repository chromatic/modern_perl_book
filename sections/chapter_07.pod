=head0 Objects

Programming is a management activity. The larger the program, the more details
you must manage. Our only hope to manage this complexity is to exploit
abstraction (treating similar things similarly) and encapsulation (grouping
related details together).

Functions alone are insufficient for large problems. Several techniques group
functions into units of related behaviors--one popular technique is object
orientation. Perl 5's default object system is flexible, but minimal. You can
build great things on top of it, but it provides little assistance for some
basic tasks.
