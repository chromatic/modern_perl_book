=head0 Perl and Its Community

Perl 5's greatest accomplishment is the huge amount of reusable libraries
developed for it. Where Perl 4 had forks to connect to databases such as Oracle
and Sybase, for example, Perl 5 had a real extension mechanism. Larry wanted
people to create and maintain their own extensions without fragmenting Perl
into thousands of incompatible pidgins--and it worked.

That technical accomplishment was almost as important as the growth of a community
around Perl 5. I<People> write libraries. I<People> build on the work of other
people. I<People> make a community worth joining and preserving and expanding.

The Perl community is strong and healthy. It welcomes willing participants at
all levels, from novices to core developers. Take advantage of the knowledge
and experience of countless other Perl programmers, and you'll become a better
programmer.
