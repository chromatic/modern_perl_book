=head0 Perl and Its Community

One of Larry's main goals for Perl 5 was to encourage Perl development and
evolution outside the core distribution.  Perl 4 had several forks, because
there was no easy way to connect it to a relational database, for example.
Larry wanted people to create and maintain their own extensions without
fragmenting Perl into thousands of incompatible pidgins.

You can add technical mechanisms for extensions, but you must also consider
community aspects as well.  Extensions and enhancements that no one shares are
extensions and enhancements that everyone has to build and test and debug and
maintain themselves.  Yet shared extensions and libraries are worthless if you
can't find them, or you can't enhance them, or you don't have permission to use
them.

Fortunately, the Perl community exists.  It's strong and healthy.  It welcomes
willing participants at all levels--and not just for people who produce and
share code.  Consider taking advantage of the knowledge and experience of
countless other Perl programmers, and sharing your abilities as well.
