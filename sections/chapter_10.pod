=head0 Perl Beyond Syntax

Perl 5 is a large language, like any language intended to solve problems in the
real world.  Effective Perl programs require more than mere understanding of
syntax; you must also begin to understand how Perl's features interact and
common ways of solving well-understood problems in Perl.

Prepare for the second learning curve of Perl: Perlish thinking. The effective
use of common patterns of behavior and builtin shortcuts allow you to write
concise and powerful code.
