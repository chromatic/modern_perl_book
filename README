What is Modern Perl?
--------------------

Perl is a popular, powerful, and widely used programming language.  Over its
twenty year lifespan, it's powered millions of systems worldwide, moving
trillions of dollars.  More importantly, it's helped countless people get their
work done effectively.

The Perl community has a reputation for clever solutions -- and a reputation
for institutional knowledge that isn't always clear to novices and neophytes.
Modern Perl, written with this knowledge, can be very clean, very maintainable,
and very effective.

That knowledge should be available to everyone.  This book will teach you how
to program Perl well by teaching you how to understand Perl's design, its
syntax, and its semantics.

Intended Audience
-----------------

I assume readers have some familiarity with Perl.  They should have it
installed and should know how to write, edit, save, and run Perl programs.
They don't necessarily have to have finished reading a tutorial such as
Learning Perl or Beginning Perl, but they should be sufficiently familiar with
programming to be able to follow along with examples.

I try not to assume complete knowledge of even basic constructs; I try to
explain them in detail, as understanding subtleties of design and
implementation are important to mastering the subject of Perl.


Reviewer Guidelines
-------------------

I appreciate all suggestions and critiques, especially:

 * is the work accurate?
 * is the work complete?
 * is the work coherent?
 * are there missing sections and subjects?
 * are the examples effective?
 * is the flow of information appropriate?


Building this Book
------------------

You need a modern version of Perl installed.  I recommend Perl 5.10.1, but
anything newer than 5.8.6 should work.

You should also have Pod::PseudoPod 0.16 or newer installed with its
dependencies.

From the top level directory of a checkout, build the individual chapters with:

    $ perl build/tools/build_chapters.pl

The chapter sources are in the sections/ directory.  Each chapter has a
corresponding chapter_nn.pod file.  Each file contains multiple POD links which
refer to other files in the sections/ directory.  Each of those files contains
a PseudoPOD Z<> anchor.

The build_chapters.pl program weaves these sections into chapters and writes
them to POD files in build/chapters.

(This process makes it easy to rearrange sections within and between chapters
without generating huge diffs.)

To build HTML from these woven chapters:

    $ perl build/tools/build_html.pl

This will produce nicely-formatted HTML in the build/html/ directory.  If
anything looks wrong, it's a mistake on my part (or a CSS problem) and patches
are very welcome.

To build an ePub eBook from the woven chapters:

    $ perl build/tools/build_epub.pl

This will produce an ePub eBook in the build/epub/ directory.
